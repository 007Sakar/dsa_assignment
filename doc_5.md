# Graph Traversal Using BFS and DFS

## Objective
To implement Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) on an undirected graph.

## Data Structure Used
- Adjacency matrix to represent the graph
- Array to track visited vertices

## Functions Implemented
- `DFS()`  
  Performs depth-first traversal using recursion.

- `BFS()`  
  Performs breadth-first traversal using a queue.

## main() Overview
- Takes number of vertices and adjacency matrix as input.
- Performs DFS starting from vertex 0.
- Resets visited array.
- Performs BFS starting from vertex 0.
