# Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm

## Objective
To find the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.

## Data Structure Used
- Cost matrix
- Distance array
- Visited array

## Algorithm Used
Dijkstra’s algorithm.

## main() Overview
- Takes graph cost matrix as input.
- Takes source vertex from the user.
- Calculates shortest distance to all other vertices.
- Displays the shortest paths.
